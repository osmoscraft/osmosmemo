- Provide your GitHub username and repo.
  - If you don't have a repo yet, it's easiest to [create from the template](https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Fosmoscraft%2Fosmosmemo-template%2Fgenerate).
  - You can set the visibility of your repo to either Public or Private. The extension works in both cases.
- [Create a new personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) for the extension to add content on behalf of you. Make sure you select the `repo` scope.

- Use `README.md` as the storage filename. Other filenames work too but GitHub will not automatically render it as the home page for your repo.
- Click Connect and make sure you get a success message.
